## Security
**_Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources._**

Security is a paramount concern in today's computer science world. In each of my courses, there has been a focus on security and the risks that present themselves in various situations. As a result, I learned the following skills to protect systems and data:
- Thorough code review to ensure that all security measures are taken and all company standards are upheld within the written code. 
- Take necessary precautions to prevent unauthorized access to data such as two-factor authentication, restricted user permissions to view and/or change data, and strong passwords that cannot be easily hacked. 
- Provide physical protection of work stations, IT closets, and other vital hardware to prevent security breaches. 
- Encourage best practices by users when accessing company networks, business/personal emails, installing software/programs, and using the internet in general.
