## Communicating to Stakeholders
**_Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts._**

In my SNHU courses, I developed a professional manner of communicating through speaking, writing, and visual demonstrations. I learned to speak in detail regarding coding languages, structures, best practices, databases, and IT setups. A good demonstration of my speaking abilities is my code review for my capstone course, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbeO9yoMm24&feature=youtu.be). Additionally, this code review demonstrates my code writing skills that follow best practices in design and appropriate commenting, which allows others to easily read/follow. Finally, my code review highlights my ability to organize a coherent presentation of information geared toward specific audiences.
