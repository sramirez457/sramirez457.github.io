## Communicating to Stakeholders
**_Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts._**

In my SNHU courses, I have developed a professional manner of communicating through speaking, writing, and visual demonstrations. I learned to talk in detail about coding, structures, databases, and IT setups. A good demonstration of my speaking abilities is in my code review for my capstone course, found here. Additionally, this code review demonstrates my code writing skills that are easily read by others. Finally, my code review highlights my ability to organize a coherent presentation of information.
