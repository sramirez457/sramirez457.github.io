## Data Structures and Algorithms
**_Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices._**

   The artifact I chose for Enhancement Two is my final project from CS340, which I created last semester. My final project was to create a reporting service for basic stock market securities information using MongoDB and the RESTful API web-based protocol. For Enhancement Two, I chose to focus on the portion of the project where I created code to query the collection to retrieve information about the application. My two prompts were as follows: 
   
1.	Create a function or method in Python that will take as inputs numerical values for low and high. The function or method will find documents for which the “50-Day Simple Moving Average” is between the low and high values and return the count of the number of documents you found. 
2.	Create a function of method in Python that will take as input a string. The function or method will find documents for which the input string matches the document key “Industry” and returns the list of ticker symbols found to match that industry. 

I selected this artifact because the original code I submitted was effective in performing the required functions, but it lacked efficiency. Additionally, the updated code I created allows for user input, rather than the user having to change the file each time a new search parameter is needed. Also, there are less lines of code, so it has become a more efficient data structure. By making these changes, I met my course objectives for data structures and algorithms. Upon reflection, I found the process of developing these codes to be challenging and educational.
