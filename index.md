You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sramirez457/sramirez457.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Computer Science Skills

I gained the following skills throughout my coursework at SNHU:

- Programming with Python, C++, and Java languages
- 3D annimation rendering in Eclipse with OpenGL
- IT equipment identification and troubleshooting

## Computer Science 499 Course Outcomes
```
Outcomes are ...
```

### Collaborating in a Team Environment
Employ strategies for building environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science. 

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sramirez457/sramirez457.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Communicating to Stakeholders
Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. 

### Software Engineering and Database
Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. 

### Security
Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
