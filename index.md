# Welcome to Shelby Ramirez's ePortfolio
```
The time I spent working in the Computer Science program has been incredibly
educational. Prior to my coursework at SNHU, I had only dabbled in computers
or computer programs throughout my previous college coursework and professional 
life.

## Computer Science Skills

I gained the following skills throughout my coursework at SNHU:

- Programming with Python, C++, and Java languages
- 3D annimation rendering in Eclipse with OpenGL
- IT equipment identification and troubleshooting

### Collaborating in a Team Environment
**_Employ strategies for building environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science._**



### Communicating to Stakeholders
**_Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts._**

In my SNHU courses, I have developed a professional manner of communicating through speaking, writing, and visual demonstrations. I learned to talk in detail about coding, structures, databases, and IT setups. A good demonstration of my speaking skills are in my code review for my capstone course, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbeO9yoMm24&feature=youtu.be). Additionally, this code review also demonstrates my code writing abilities that are user-friendly to read. Finally, my code review also highlights my ability to organize a coherent presentation of information. 

### Data Structures and Algorithms
**_Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices._**

### Software Engineering and Database
**_Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals._** 

### Security
**_Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources._**
