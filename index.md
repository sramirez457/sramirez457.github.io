Prior to my coursework at SNHU, I had only dabbled in computers and computer programs in other college coursework and my professional life. Now that I have almost completed by Computer Science degree, I possess an arsenal of skills which include: 

- Programming with Python, C++, and Java languages
- 3D annimation rendering in Eclipse with OpenGL
- IT equipment installation and troubleshooting
- Navigation of operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Understanding software development roles and phases of devleopment
- Use MongoDB and mySQL to create, read, update, and delete databases and data within in them
- Develop approriate and effective hardware and software security setups for small companies
- Design and execute a Chrome F12 application that interacts with a Web SQL Database

Most recently, my computer science capstone course has provided a unique experience that encouraged me to further refine my programming skills and push myself to achieve the three required enhancements. I chose two artifacts from my previous courses that I thought would apply to my future endeavors in the construction industry. Artifact One is a 3D rendering of a stool. I considered 3D renderings would be useful in presentations of future projects, builds, and arrangements. Artifact Two focuses on the utilization of MongoDB and Python to traverse databases. Databases are a big part of construction as a method of keeping track of various types of information including reports, inventory, drawings, etc. The three enhancements I performed on the two artifacts that I included in my portfolio showcase my aptitude in the computer science capstone course outcomes listed/linked below.
