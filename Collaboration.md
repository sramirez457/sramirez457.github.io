Code development in professional environments requires team collaboration and supporting constructive code reviews. My capstone course exemplified one method of collaboration, known as GitHub. This site is just one example of how teams can work together by:
- Commenting on your own or other people's code
- Creating different branches based on changes that need to be made
- Pushing requests to the main branch once a change is verified
- Putting all projects in an organized system so that it is easily tracked
