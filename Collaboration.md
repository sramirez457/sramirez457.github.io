## Collaborating in a Team Environment
**_Employ strategies for building environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science._**

Code development in professional environments requires team collaboration and constructive code reviews. Even though there are various ways to collaborate with others, my capstone course exemplified one method, known as GitHub. This site is just one example of how teams can work together by:

- Commenting on your own or other people's code during the creation of a project
- Creating different branches based on changes that need to be made but still need to be reviewed 
- Pushing requests to the main branch once a change is agreed upon and verified 
- Putting all projects in an organized system so that they can easily be tracked
- Providing transparency in the creation of projects and enable input in decision making
